        <p id="P_128">
          <em id="EM_129">1. Puts the needs of the client first.</em> An agent who is only out to earn a commission, regardless of the needs of the client, is not likely to last long in the business. Agents and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="A_130">brokers</a> who listen carefully to what their clients and prospects say will be able to earn their trust, which is the hardest part of their job.

        <p id="P_132">
          When learning how to be a successful insurance agent, it's critical to know that agents who are willing to put their clients into a product that pays a lower commission because it better fits their needs are much more likely to retain customers.

        <div id="DIV_133">
        </div>
        <p id="P_134">
          <em id="EM_135">2. Good customer service.</em> Customers who are able to get hold of their agents when they need them are much more likely to stay happy and reassured. A timely response to inquiries and phone calls is a must, and you must be able to do what you say you will do, when you say you will do it, or at least have a good reason as to why you can't.

                One of the major complaints of those <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="A_142">who buy life insurance policies</a> is that there is no one around to answer their questions after they have purchased the policy.

          <em id="EM_144">3. Emotional intelligence.</em> This includes the ability to listen and empathize with clients on a deeper level in order to discern what they really want and need. A good agent is tactful and knows how to help a client see financial reality clearly, even when the client is dead set against it.

        <p id="P_152">
          <em id="EM_153">4. High energy level.</em> One of the most important traits of a good insurance agent is that they appear to be excited and eager at all times. A worn-down or dreary <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disposition.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="A_154">disposition</a> will immediately rub off on clients and discourage them from buying anything.

        </div>
        <p id="P_156">
          <em id="EM_157">5. Persistence.</em> This is perhaps the most vital quality of any good insurance agent. Those who work in this field absolutely must be able to handle rejection on a daily basis over the course of their careers and do it with a smile. Good insurance agents understand that each "no" only brings them closer to someone who will say "yes."

        </div>
        <p id="P_159">
          <em id="EM_160">6. Honesty.</em> Insurance agents who use deception to close business seldom stay with the same company for very longâ€”and can end up behind bars in some cases. A good agent knows that telling the truth upfront will <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0612/4-ways-to-build-your-client-book.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="A_161">win them clients' respect and trust</a> and is likely to lead to repeat business over time.

        <p id="P_166">
          <em id="EM_167">7. A wide array of products.</em> As the old saying goes, if all you have to work with is a hammer, then everything in the world looks like a nail. A good insurance agent will be able to offer a comprehensive selection of products and services that can meet any reasonable need a client might have.

        </div>
        <p id="P_169">
          <em id="EM_170">8. Technical know-how.</em> A good insurance agent knows much more than how to sell a policy. The agent must understand the tax and legal aspects of the products they sell and how they are designed to fit into a client's overall financial situation. Many agents earn financial planning designations such as the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cfp.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="A_171">Certified Financial Planner</a>Â®, Chartered Financial Counselor, or other credentials. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/07/start-your-own-firm.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="A_172">Some agents practice financial planning</a>, income tax preparation, or some other avenue of financial service as their primary profession, and then add-in insurance business when it becomes necessary.
